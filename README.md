### NS Records
When applying for NS records, please be aware we already support a [wide range of DNS records](/docs/faq.md#which-records-are-supported), so you may not need them. 

In your PR, please explain why you need NS records, including examples, to help mitigate potential abuse. Refer to the [FAQ](/docs/faq.md#who-can-use-ns-records) for guidelines on allowed usage. 

***Pull requests adding NS records without sufficient reasoning will be closed.***

## Report Abuse
If you find any subdomains being used for abusive purposes, please report them by creating an issue with the relevant evidence.
